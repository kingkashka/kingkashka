As a Fullstack Software Developer, I've demonstrated proficiency in delivering top-notch results whether working independently or as part of a team. Before transitioning to software development, I served as an air traffic controller for the United States Army, where I oversaw airspace management in dynamic tactical environments, honing my aptitude for critical thinking. This same fervor for problem-solving fuels my enthusiasm for software development. I committed over 1,000 hours to a rigorous coding bootcamp, specializing in JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Now, I'm eager to leverage these skills and passions in a challenging role within a collaborative development team, dedicated to crafting high-quality, user-friendly front-end applications.
